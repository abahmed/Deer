Contributions to Deer should be made in the form of pull requests. Each pull request will be reviewed by someone with permission to land patches. After reviewing the patch, it could be landed in the master branch or given feedback for changes. (Seems not clear to you! Don't worry, we have added tutorials on [Our Wiki](Deer/wiki/GitHub-workflow))
